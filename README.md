# Realtime-SQLdatabase

Here this project demonstrates how we can use SQL database as a real-time database. Of course, as we know, we can directly use a real-time database like firebase. Still, if we need to use SQL database only then, it becomes a challenge to handle it because SQL is not a real-time database means we can not track when the database is changing from the server side. 

So, I am trying to demonstrate how we can use SQL as a real-time database by plotting the graph which shows sensor reading and sensor is sending the reading every two seconds of interval. 

## Usage

```bash
Download the folder and put the command "npm install" in your terminal (If you have
installed then. I hope it will get executed without any error.)
Put the database name and password in the app.js file.
I am using esp82266readings as table name, so do change here, and table
columns are temperature and humidity, so make changes here.
UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT PROPERLY FIRST, AND I AM SURE IT WILL DEFINITELY HELP YOU.
